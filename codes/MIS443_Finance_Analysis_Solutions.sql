BUSINESS SCENARIO AND DATASET

The database represents a retail bank that manages customers, branches,
accounts, and account transactions. Managers use it to monitor customer value,
account balances, branch performance, and transaction activity.

- customers: one row per customer;
- branches: one row per bank branch;
- accounts: each account belongs to one customer and one branch;
- transactions: each transaction belongs to one account.

Positive account balances represent funds held by customers. Negative Credit
Card balances represent amounts owed. Positive transaction amounts are credits
and negative transaction amounts are debits.

SUBMISSION REMINDER
Submit the completed SQL file, Word report, and ERD screenshot on Moodle, and
upload the same files to your accessible personal GitHub repository.
